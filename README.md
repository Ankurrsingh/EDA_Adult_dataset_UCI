exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods.

Typical graphical techniques used in EDA are:
Box plot
Histogram
Multi-vari chart
Run chart
Pareto chart
Scatter plot
Stem-and-leaf plot
Parallel coordinates
Odds ratio
Targeted projection pursuit
Glyph-based visualization methods such as PhenoPlot[8] and Chernoff faces
Projection methods such as grand tour, guided tour and manual tour
Interactive versions of these plots
Dimensionality reduction:

Multidimensional scaling
Principal component analysis (PCA)
Multilinear PCA
Nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR)
Typical quantitative techniques are:

Median polish
Trimean
Ordination
